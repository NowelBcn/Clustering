## Clustering

In this project I developed a clustering model to segment types of wines in a dataset with its features.I tried to outperfom the model
with different models such as MiniBatch Clustering, PCA and Hierarchical Clustering and I did a confusion matrix to contrast all the scores.
I used a wine dataset to play around with the models.
